In this article, I‚Äôll present the algorithm which helps to answer the main question of all project planning efforts:

> When will it be done?

A more formal representation of this problem sounds like: ‚ÄúHaving some tasks which might depend on each other and some folks which can do those tasks when a milestone can be reached?‚Äù

Weekly sprint planning meeting in essence

# A Little Backstory

In 2019-2021 I work as a tech lead. I was responsible for 3 different projects with a team of 11 developers, 2 managers, 2 designers, and several departments to cooperate with.

For task tracking, we‚Äôre using our internal tool [Yandex Tracker](https://yandex.ru/tracker/) which is mostly like Jira. But it has no tools that‚Äôll help to find the answer for an eternal question: ‚ÄúWhen?‚Äù. That‚Äôs why from time to time we manually sync tasks with **Omniplan**. Turned out that it‚Äôs the tool that solves almost all project planning problems and moreover it has an **auto-planning feature** so all situations when one assignee has workload over 100% are resolved automatically.

Still, it has some drawbacks:

- Slow and unreliable project sync between team mates based on a local copy syncing
- MacOS only
- Quite hard to sync it with our issue tracker
- Pricey: $200 and $400 for Pro edition

So I‚Äôve decided to try to make my own Omniplan version with blackjack and hookers that would be:

- Web-based
- Simple syncing with our tracker
- With real-time collaboration

The most exciting part was to make **a scheduling engine**. I didn‚Äôt understand why only Omniplan has such an essential feature. Now I do.

So this article is about scheduling.

# Developing a scheduling engine

First I‚Äôve done some research. I‚Äôve googled for solving scheduling tasks in general and found a lot of about [Gantt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart), [PERT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_evaluation_and_review_technique), but haven‚Äôt found any practical algorithms.

Then I looked for open-source libraries and found only one: [Bryntum Chronograph](https://github.com/bryntum/chronograph). It seems like something I was looking for all the time. They even have [benchmarks](https://github.com/bryntum/scheduler-performance). But, well, talking honestly I didn‚Äôt understand [any of its code](https://github.com/bryntum/chronograph/blob/master/src/chrono/Graph.ts) and almost complete lack of documentation didn‚Äôt help either. I thought maybe, what if I could write it from scratch with less code.

So, as usual, I‚Äôve tried to draw the problem.

![Timeline of tasks before scheduling](/img/for_posts/task_planning/1.png)
_Timeline of tasks before scheduling_

While drawing it I‚Äôve probably got the most important insight: tasks can be represented as a directed graph and edges are not only the explicit dependencies but also _implicit dependencies by the same assignee_.

The following algorithm should lead to such tasks arrangement:

![Timeline of tasks after scheduling](/img/for_posts/task_planning/2.png)
_Timeline of tasks after scheduling_

Let‚Äôs consider what a task is:

![Task anatomy](/img/for_posts/task_planning/3.png)
_Task anatomy_

There are some not so obvious properties of a task:

- **Duration**. The task is being done only during _business_ days and the number of _business_ days is an _estimation_ of a task. So in this example the task starts on 2 March, has an estimation of 6 days, so it will end on 9 March (_not 7 March_), because 7 and 8 March are holidays.
- **Position**. In this model, we assume that tasks with lower positions (same as a higher priority) should be done earlier than a task with higher positions (or lower priority).
- **Progress**. It is a portion of a task that can be represented in percents but in fact, it is a number of days that were spent on a task. For example, if a task is estimated up to 4 days and, then progress is 75%, that 1 day left to task completion.

So TypeScript type is as follows (_ID is just an alias for string_):

```typescript
export type Task = {
  id: ID;
  title: string;
  start: Date;
  end: Date;
  duration: number;

  /**
   * Approximation of priority
   */
  position: number;
  progress: number;
  resourceId: ID;
  /**
   * Current task blocked by these tasks (depends on)
   */
  blockedBy?: Array<ID>;
};
```

# The algorithm

In essence, the algorithm should change start and end dates of the tasks in the following way:

1.  Tasks should start today if it is possible
2.  It should be impossible to start a task today if it has other tasks as prerequisites that are unfinished. In that case, a task should start right after the last prerequisite‚Äôs end date.

Pretty simple, huh? üôà

The main steps of the algorithm are:

1.  **Build a graph from tasks.** Make edges taking into account explicit dependencies and implicit dependencies by the same assignee.

```typescript
/**
 * Graph respects explicit dependencies
 * and implicit by resources (via positions)
 */
export const makeGraphFromTasks = (tasks: Array<Task>): Graph => {
  // task and blockedBy
  const graph: Graph = new Map();
  const resourcesTasks = new Map<ID, Array<Task>>();

  // Create graphs
  for (const t of tasks) {
    // resource and its tasks
    const tasksOfResource = resourcesTasks.get(t.resourceId) ?? [];
    tasksOfResource.push(t);

    resourcesTasks.set(t.resourceId, tasksOfResource);

    graph.set(t.id, new Set(t.blockedBy ?? []));
  }

  // Now add deps
  for (const tasksOfResource of resourcesTasks.values()) {
    // first sort by position so links of tasks starts with higher position
    // then topological sort to reduce cyclic deps
    tasksOfResource.sort((a, b) => a.position - b.position);
    // is toposort needed?
    const sortedTasks = toposort(graph, tasksOfResource);

    // add to graph such edges so current node has prev as dependency (blocked by prev)
    let prevTask: Task | void;
    for (const task of sortedTasks) {
      if (
        prevTask &&
        prevTask.id !== task.id &&
        // has no incoming edge as well (otherwise it will be cyclic dep)
        !graph.get(prevTask.id)?.has(task.id)
      ) {
        graph.get(task.id)?.add(prevTask.id);
      }
      prevTask = task;
    }
  }

  return graph;
};
```

**2.Remove circular dependencies.** If cycles are present throw an error because that means that some task A has as prerequisite task B and task B has as prerequisite task A, which is a classic problem of [circular dependency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_dependency) and the problem should be resolved manually. Tasks A and B do not necessarily have an explicit dependency on each other, there are might some other tasks between them.

```typescript
/**
 * Main source of cyclic dependencies is previous step where graph is created
 * Often top-level task has same owner as children tasks
 * Since we create edge in graph also by same owner that's why there is cyclic deps
 *
 * IDEA: mitigate the issue by starting DFS walk from top-level (source) tasks!
 */
export const removeCyclicDependencies = (
  graph: Graph,
  tasks: Array<Task>
): void => {
  // Track visited to avoid computing path for already computed nodes
  const visited = new Set();
  let cyclicDepsRemovedCount = 0;

  const dfsAndRemove = (rootTaskId: ID) => {
    // [current task ID, set of previously visited tasks]
    const stack: Array<[ID, Set<ID>]> = [[rootTaskId, new Set()]];

    while (stack.length > 0) {
      const nextValue = stack.pop();
      nullthrows(nextValue);
      const [taskId, prevSet] = nextValue;

      const blockedBy = graph.get(taskId) ?? new Set();

      visited.add(taskId);

      for (const blockedById of blockedBy) {
        // cycle detected!
        if (prevSet.has(blockedById)) {
          // remove that edge
          blockedBy.delete(blockedById);
          cyclicDepsRemovedCount++;
          continue;
        }

        const newPrevSet = new Set(prevSet);
        newPrevSet.add(blockedById);
        stack.push([blockedById, newPrevSet]);
      }
    }
  };

  for (const task of tasks) {
    if (visited.has(task.id)) {
      continue;
    }

    dfsAndRemove(task.id);
  }

  console.debug("Cyclic deps removed:", cyclicDepsRemovedCount);
};
```

**3\. Visit every node (task) and update a start and end dates.** Visiting should be performed starting from the task with higher priority

If a task is a source (it is not a prerequisite for any other task and task‚Äôs assignee has no other task to do before this task) or a task is disconnected node (it has no dependencies and it is not prerequisite for any other tasks) then we start task today.

Otherwise, a task has prerequisites and its start date should be set to the latest end date of its prerequisites tasks.

Also, it is important to correctly **update an end date while setting a start date of a task**. We should take into account actual business days and the progress of a task.

```typescript
export const scheduleTasks = (
  inputTasks: Array<Task>,
  today: Date = getNowDate()
): Array<Task> => {
  const dayBeforeToday = subtractDays(today, 1);
  const tasks: Array<Task> = inputTasks.map((t) => ({ ...t }));
  const tasksById: TasksById = Object.fromEntries(tasks.map((t) => [t.id, t]));
  const graph = makeGraphFromTasks(tasks);
  let cyclesToFullyUpdateDates = 1;

  // 1. Remove cyclic dependencies
  removeCyclicDependencies(graph, tasks);

  // 2. Initial update of all tasks start and ends days taking into account business days
  for (const task of tasks) {
    updateTaskDatesByStart(task, today, true);
  }

  // Repeat until dates remains unchanged, max graph.size times.
  // Similar to optimization in Bellman-Ford algorithm
  // @see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman‚ÄìFord_algorithm#Improvements
  for (let i = 0; i < tasks.length; i++) {
    let isAnyTaskTimelineChanged = false;

    for (const [taskId] of dfs(graph)) {
      const task = tasksById[taskId];
      // if blockedBy task not in initial data set
      if (task === undefined) {
        continue;
      }
      const blockedByTasks = Array.from(graph.get(task.id) ?? [])
        .map((blockedById) => tasksById[blockedById])
        // do not take into account tasks not in graph
        .filter(Boolean);
      const blockedByEndDates = blockedByTasks.map((t) => t.end);
      // add dayBeforeToday by default, so task without blockedBy starts on today
      blockedByEndDates.push(dayBeforeToday);

      // Start task on the next day after previous (blockedBy) tasks ends
      const maxBlockedByEndDate = addDays(maxDateTime(blockedByEndDates), 1);
      const isTaskTimelineUpdated = updateTaskDatesByStart(
        task,
        maxBlockedByEndDate
      );
      if (isTaskTimelineUpdated) {
        isAnyTaskTimelineChanged = true;
      }
    }

    if (isAnyTaskTimelineChanged === false) {
      break;
    }
    cyclesToFullyUpdateDates++;

    if (isAnyTaskTimelineChanged && i === tasks.length - 1) {
      console.error(
        'It\'s not enought "tasks.length" interations to fully schedule all tasks!'
      );
    }
  }

  console.debug(
    `Cycles to fully update dates ${cyclesToFullyUpdateDates}/${tasks.length}`
  );

  // for better representation
  return toposort(graph, tasks);
};
```

# What can be improved

1.  Probably the most important feature which leads to a more complex solution is introducing **a desirable start date** of a task. I didn‚Äôt research it yet, but if someday it will grow to a standalone web-service I think it should be done. Now, this feature can be mitigated by setting proper priorities of tasks.
2.  For the enterprise-grade solution, it is important to take into account vacations and public holidays. I think **updateStartDate** function can be quite easily updated to support this functionality.
3.  For my case having a **day** as a time quant was okay, but I believe for some people **hour**\-based planning might be important. I think implementing an hour-based quant can also introduce some complications to code.
