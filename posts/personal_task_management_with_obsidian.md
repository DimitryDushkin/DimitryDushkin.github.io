As we discussed in the post ["When you're overwhelmed, simplify"](https://dushkin.tech/posts/when_you_overwhelmed_simplify/), simplifying complex tasks is crucial. This is especially true when you're involved in multiple workstreams and collaborate with dozens of people simultaneously every day.

My main tool in such cases is the preservation and structuring of information, supplemented by a few automations. The process focuses on:

- Gathering all input that helps in solving tasks,
- Structuring tasks by categorizing them into projects,
- Ranking projects by their current importance,
- Highlighting the most important tasks at the moment,
- Preserving a list of completed tasks for compiling a performance self-review twice a year.

Research shows [3, 4] that distributing different aspects of a task to different areas of the brain usually yields better results. I see personal task management as one of these ways of dealing with everyday activity which adds value overall and unloads a brain with tons of staff.

## On my process

_Video with process in the nutshell: creating tasks, list of most imporatant tasks, archiving tasks_

The process is focused around **"Tasks"** page with a following structure:

- First section is **High-priority tasks**..
- Second section is **Projects list** sorted by projects' priority.
- Third section is for tasks without specific project.

### High-priority tasks

This section is generated by filter provided by [Tasks](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Introduction) community plugin. Here's how query looks like:

````
```tasks
not done
priority is above medium
```
````

It's a live list which auto-updates on changes. Tasks provides tons of filters. I also use one more filter on tasks with `#code` tag to distinguish tasks where I need to code something. I'm trying to plan ,my day in way to spend a least some time on coding.

### Projects list

It's a heading and a list of tasks.
Each project's title is also a linked reference to another page which contains important information on a project like:

- short description,
- links to documents,
- timelines,
- POCs,
- etc.

### Un-allocated tasks

No every task fits into some project, so it's useful to have section.

## On other aspects of Obsidian I use

- I make extensive use of Obsidian's **inter-linking** feature, which organizes references quickly and effectively.
  - By inter-linking I mean wrapping topic, peoples, subjects, etc. in `[[]]` so it becomes a link to a page.
  - By clicking on link Obsidian will create a page if not exists yet.
- I also create pages for posts I'm preparing, for notes on different topics, ideas, plans, etc. Main starting point for those is usually a daily page provided by core plugin "**Daily Note**".
- Although I don't use the whiteboard feature, preferring a physical notebook or iPad, it seems promising.
- **Another plugins I use**
  - I use “**Task Archiver**” community plugin to gather completed tasks in dedicated page. It helps a lot during performance review twice a year. I configured it to move completed tasks to a different page like this:
    - ![Task anatomy](/img/for_posts/task_management/task_managment_archiver_setup.png)
  - I'm using "**Omnisearch**" community plugin which gives in-text search capabilities. Hope it will make to core since text search is essential for such app IMHO.
  - I'm a big fan of lists and "**Outliner**" plugin gives almost everything I need for it like list operations shortcuts, indentation lines, etc.

## Conclusion

In the process described above I tried to save a balance between complexity of the flow and value it provides. Hope it will hit a right spot for you too!

Great post with even more automations around task management via Obsidian. That's where I found out about Archiver plugin. Previously I used Text Transport plugin which is less suitable for tasks specifically.
